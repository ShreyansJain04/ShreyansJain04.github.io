# About Me

I'm Shreyans Jain, a third-year undergraduate at IIT Gandhinagar pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering. My passion lies in cutting-edge research in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing. I have been actively involved in innovative projectsâ€”from developing robust AI image classifiers and artifact detection frameworks to designing hardware-accelerated neural network models on FPGA. 

My work has earned recognition such as a Silver Medal at the Inter IIT Tech Meet 13.0, and I continually strive to build solutions that merge advanced research with real-world application.
