- Developed a detection framework using the LeViT model and NPR to identify AI-generated images.
- Achieved 99.21% accuracy on the CIFAKE dataset, securing the highest accuracy among competitors.
- Extending the project with robust techniques for out-of-distribution generative models.
- Exploring adversarial training, jigsaw-style self-supervised learning, and continual learning.
