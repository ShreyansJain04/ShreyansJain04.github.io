**Course Project** â€“ Mentor: Prof. Joycee Mekie, IIT Gandhinagar

- Designed and implemented a fixed-point quantized Variational Autoencoder for processing the MNIST dataset on an FPGA.
- Verified image reconstruction fidelity against software-based PyTorch models.
- Achieved latency reductions enabling near-instantaneous inference.
