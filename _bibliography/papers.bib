  abstract={We present a combined U-Net and diffusion model to remove streak artifacts in therapeutic ultrasound imaging. Using a denoising U-Net with skip connections and text-based prompts for enhanced inpainting, initial results show effective artifact removal, an improved Signal-to-Noise Ratio by 6.0 Â± 3.4 dB, and an IOU score of 0.698. Rapid model convergence suggests potential for real-time clinical use. Future work will validate the model on diverse datasets and optimize performance.},
